                    <p>The vision for the application originated from StartRight's need to streamline
                        and expedite the contract creation process. Following the initial conversation
                        and understanding of their requirements, a collaborative effort was initiated to
                        develop a concept aimed at simplifying the work processes of the student
                        organization. The objective was to create not only a contract generator but an
                        entire application with additional features to enhance the efficiency of
                        StartRight's operations.</p>

                    <p>Prior to delving into the concept, extensive research was conducted on existing tools
                        with similar functionalities. Through multiple meetings with the students from
                        StartRight, exploration of additional features and ideas that could serve as
                        meaningful extensions to the application took place. These discussions and
                        considerations shaped the goals for the project. Regular communication and
                        collaboration with StartRight ensured that the application met their exact
                        requirements and expectations.</p>

                <h2>1. Mockup:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>All ideas and considerations from the concept phase were formalized into a structured plan, providing a clear roadmap for development. The meticulous planning phase, including mockups and prototypes, laid a strong foundation for the development process, reducing the likelihood of unexpected challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. Prototype:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>With the concept solidified, the transition to the implementation phase began, creating the first prototype. This crucial step allowed for the visualization of the application's flow and functionality. During this phase, the decision was made to build the project entirely from scratch, utilizing a carefully selected tech stack.</p>
                <br>
               <h2>3. Tech Stack:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The entire project was built from the scratch both backend and frontend, using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and employing the following tech stack:</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <br><div class="item"><strong>HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap</strong> for front-end development.</div>
                    <div class="item">Node.js as the open-source server environment, providing a script structure for websites.</div>
                    <div class="item">Express, an extension of Node.js, serving as a lightweight web framework to handle all requests.</div>
                    <div class="item">MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database management system, for efficient data organization.</div>
                    <div class="item">Mongoose, a schema-based solution, simplifying data management.</div>
